## 👋 Hi, I’m Anna

I'm a **Business and Data Analyst** with over 3 years of experience, based in **Basel, Switzerland**. I help companies **simplify processes** to save **time and money**.

I studied **linguistics and public relations** in **Poland and Italy**, building a strong foundation in communication and business.  
My career path has taken me from **communications in Poland**, through **supply chain and finance in Germany**, to **biotech and medtech in Switzerland** since 2022.

One of my proudest achievements?  
💡 I helped a biotech startup **save over 135,000 CHF per year** by creating a smarter procurement process and renegotiating vendor contracts — a turning point that deepened my passion for analytics.
